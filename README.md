# Microcontroller-Based-LED-Blinker-
Created a simulation of an embedded LED blinking system using ISR-based button handling and GPIO control. included an LED sequence for starting and integrated ambient light (lux) input for automatic blinking control. Real-time event logging was incorporated to simulate the behavior of embedded systems without the need for hardware.
